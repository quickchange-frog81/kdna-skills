# KDNA Loader Skill

Use this skill to load KDNA domain cognition before responding to domain-specific tasks.

KDNA shapes judgment — framing, diagnosis, terminology, and self-checks — before output generation.

## File Locations

**Default KDNA root:** `~/.kdna/`

All Agents share the same KDNA directory. If your Agent uses a different root, create a symlink:

```
ln -s ~/.kdna ~/.claude/Kdna   # Claude Code
ln -s ~/.kdna ~/.codex/Kdna    # Codex
ln -s ~/.kdna ~/.agents/Kdna   # OpenCode
```

**Project-level roots (checked in order):** `./kdna/`, `./Kdna/`

Prefer project-level over global. Domain folders use `snake_case` (e.g., `business_growth/`).

## When to Use

**Use KDNA:** user asks for expert judgment, diagnosis, review, critique, reasoning, strategy, or transformation in a domain that has KDNA files.

**Skip KDNA:** purely mechanical tasks (format, extract, translate), or when domain judgment would not change the output. See [meta-cognition rules](https://github.com/knowledge-dna/KDNA/blob/main/docs/meta-cognition.md) for detailed guidance.

## Domain Auto-Matching

When the user's request does not name a domain but implies one, use keyword matching to select the best available KDNA:

| Signal | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| "review writing", "edit", "is this good", "feedback on", "argument", "hook", "content diagnosis", "写作诊断", "文章问题" | writing |
| "notes", "knowledge base", "pkm", "obsidian", "notion", "second brain", "saved", "知识管理", "笔记" | knowledge_management |
| "prompt not working", "fix prompt", "why did this prompt", "prompt diagnosis", "task mixing", "prompt优化", "提示词问题" | prompt_diagnosis |
| "delete file", "organize files", "clean up", "remove", "safety", "irreversible", "before deleting", "安全", "删除文件" | agent_safety |
| "open source", "github repo", "adoption", "stars", "why no users", "开源", "项目采用" | open_source_project |
| "content idea", "what to write", "topic", "content strategy", "选题", "内容策略", "写什么" | content_strategy |
| "meeting", "decision", "discussion", "action items", "会议", "决策" | decision_state |

Match algorithm:
1. Score each installed domain by keyword hits in user input (case-insensitive).
2. If no domain scores above threshold, do not load KDNA.
3. If one domain clearly leads, load it. Prefer `stable` over `experimental` when scores tie.
4. If multiple domains score high and conflict is possible, load one as leader and flag the conflict.

## Domain Selection (Manual)

1. Search the KDNA root for folders matching the user's task.
2. Check `kdna.json` manifest for `keywords` and `description`.
3. Prefer `stable` > `basic` > `experimental`.
4. One leading domain is usually sufficient. Load secondary domains only as constraints.

## Loading Rules

**Always load:** `KDNA_Core.json` + `KDNA_Patterns.json`

**Conditionally load:**

| File | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `KDNA_Scenarios.json` | Concrete situation, conflict, case, objection, decision context |
| `KDNA_Cases.json` | Examples, demonstrations, before/after comparison requested |
| `KDNA_Reasoning.json` | "Why", principles, logic behind a judgment requested |
| `KDNA_Evolution.json` | Practice, improvement, progress, capability level requested |

## Loading Log

Before responding, record internally (not in user-facing output):

```
[KDNA] loaded: <domain>@<version> | modules: core, patterns [+ scenarios, cases, reasoning, evolution] | mode: <minimum|auto|all>
```

For debug mode, expose this to the user:

```
Loaded KDNA: sales@0.1.0
Applied modules: core, patterns, scenarios
Mode: judgment shaping
```

## Applying KDNA

1. Internalize axioms and stances as the domain frame.
2. Use preferred terminology; avoid banned terms even if the user uses them.
3. Detect likely misunderstandings in the user's framing.
4. Apply frameworks and scenario signals to classify the situation.
5. Use reasoning chains when explaining rationale.
6. Run self-check items before final output.
7. Produce a domain-shaped answer — not a KDNA summary.

## Response Protocol

**Normal tasks:** Do not announce loading. Don't quote KDNA. Don't say "According to KDNA…" Answer directly with judgment shaped silently by the domain.

**Debugging:** State which domain was loaded, report missing/ invalid files, flag terminology conflicts, suggest file-level fixes.

## Multi-Domain

1. Load Core + Patterns for each candidate.
2. Compare axioms and terminology. Choose one leading domain.
3. Use secondary domains as constraints only.
4. **Surface conflicts — never silently blend contradictory guidance.** Tell the user: "Domain A interprets this as X. Domain B sees it as Y. Which perspective fits better?"

## Conflict Arbitration

When domains conflict: user intent > specific domain > general domain > evidence > boundary declaration. If a domain says "do NOT cover X" and the task is about X, that domain disqualifies itself. See [meta-cognition: conflict arbitration](https://github.com/knowledge-dna/KDNA/blob/main/docs/meta-cognition.md#3-conflict-arbitration).

## Failure Handling

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| No KDNA root | Continue without KDNA. If user requested KDNA, report expected path. |
| Domain folder missing | Report not found. Do not fabricate. |
| Required files missing | Report which files. Minimum: `KDNA_Core.json` + `KDNA_Patterns.json`. |
| JSON invalid | Report the file. Continue with valid files if possible. |
| Optional files missing | Not fatal. Continue with Core + Patterns. |

## Quality Boundary

KDNA does not replace tools, APIs, RAG, workflows, execution skills, or source verification. KDNA shapes judgment — evidence and user intent take priority when they conflict with domain axioms.
